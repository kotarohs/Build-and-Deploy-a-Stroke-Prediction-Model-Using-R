## Summary
This project builds a stroke prediction model using R, utilizing a healthcare dataset to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on patient demographics and medical history.

## Solution
The project preprocesses and cleans the data, visualizes key features, and builds a machine learning model using Random Forest. The model is then evaluated for accuracy and deployed for real-time predictions.

## Approach
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed with visualizations to understand the relationships between features and stroke occurrence. Random Forest is used for classification, and model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
